# NodeJS coding test

One challenge we have at Littledata is to categorise our client's websites by industry sector, so we can compare them with websites from the same industry.

Your task is to:

1. Pick an appropriate API to use (a paid-for API is fine, providing it has free trial usage) which categorises websites into IAB Sectors - https://www.iab.com/guidelines/iab-quality-assurance-guidelines-qag-taxonomy/

2. Write a function to accept a website URL and return an industry category and subcategory from the API

3. Extend the function to iterate over an array of 2000 URLs

We are looking for well structured and commented code, and in the 2nd interview we will ask why you made certain design choices.

Some example websites you may want to test with:

http://shop.panthers.com

http://www.radisson.com

http://www.hobby-lobby.com

http://www.enjoylifefoods.com
